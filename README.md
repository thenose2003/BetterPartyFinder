# BetterPartyFinder
The sever client designed for the open source project to make skill based matchmaking for the catacombs in hypixel skyblock.

The skill of a player is assessed by takling the amount of a dungeon they completed vs the total amount avalible to be done in a dungeon.
A player is expected to complete 20% of a dungeon in a similar skill level party

One of the major obsticles about this project is to make sure that all information being sent from the client is valid
At the time of writing this, the major idea behind the anticheat system will be to constantly update the server and verify across possibility and clients.
